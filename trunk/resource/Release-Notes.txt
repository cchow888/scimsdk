---------- SCIM 1.5.0 ----------

  * Release Date: November 15, 2013

  * This is an upgrade release with some significant enhancements. Users of
    previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

  * New Features

    - Refactor the SCIMBackend API so ResourceDescriptors may be retrieved. Use
      Path templates with one Wink resource instead of creating a Wink resource
      per resource type. Add the HttpServletRequest into the various Request
      objects so they can be used by the SCIMBackend. Issue: DS-9385

    - Add a utility class to generate a diff between two SCIM resources which is
      useful for performing update operations using PATCH instead of PUT.
      Issue: DS-9055

    - Add support for the "operation" sub-attribute to the Entry class that
      represents a single value of a multi-valued attribute. This sub-attribute
      is used to mark a specific value for deletion in a PATCH operation.

    - Enhance the SCIMObject.removeAttribute() method to support removing
      specific sub-attributes. Issue: DS-9008

  * Resolved Issues

    - Fix an issue in the JSONParser where it could let non-core attributes slip
      through when they were not qualified with a schema URN. Issue: DS-7965

    - Fix an issue where the equals() method on SCIMAttribute depended on the
      ordering of the values. Issue: DS-9008

    - Fix a bug that allowed SCIM requests to update attributes that were
      designated as 'read only' in the SCIM resource schema. Issue: DS-9068

    - Ensure that each element of a SCIM bulk response's operations list
      includes a location field when required. Issue: DS-7360

    - Update SCIM to use version 1.3.0 of the Wink libraries and version 4.2.6
      of the Apache HttpClient libraries. Issue:DS-8517


---------- SCIM 1.3.2 ----------

  * Release Date: April 28, 2013

  * This is a maintenance release that improves quality, reliability, and
    performance and adds some minimal enhancements. All users of previous
    1.3.x releases should upgrade to this release.

  * New Features

     - Update the scim-query-rate tool to support authenticating with an
       OAuth bearer token. Issue:DS-7581

     - Protect SCIM from XML entity expansion attacks. Issue:DS-8081

  * Resolved Issues

     - Fix an issue where using a filter that includes a simpleMultiValued
       attribute from a custom schema would not return any results.
       Issue:DS-8226

     - Fix an issue where exceptions thrown during unmarshalling of bulk
       operations will fail the entire bulk request. Issue:DS-7399

     - Fix an issue where the SCIM SDK would not populate the response body and
       would only return the HTTP headers when validating an OAuth token.
       Issue:DS-7580

     - Update the bulk operation response to consistently include the location
       field. Issue:DS-7360


---------- SCIM 1.3.0 ----------

  * Release Date: January 23, 2013

  * This is an upgrade release with some significant enhancements. Users of
    previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

  * New Features

     - Update the SCIM Reference Implementation and SDK to use the 'entryUUID'
       as the SCIM ID by default, instead of the DN. This is still configurable
       via the resources.xml file. Issue:DS-7267

     - Add a size-limit to the LDAP search requests generated by SCIM if they
       are not going to use the VLV request control. This prevents certain
       searches from taking a very long time and/or bogging down the server
       when they're only going to return a small subset of the total results
       to the SCIM client. Issue:DS-7846

     - Add support for specifying arbitrary URL query parameters when performing
       a search via SCIM. Issue:DS-7267

     - Improve JSON parsing to be more lenient and handle data from multiple
       schemas more efficiently. Issue:DS-7267

     - Add support for a "non-strict mode" and a "default schema" in the
       ResourceDescriptor and Attribute-related classes so that callers can
       request and use attributes that are not explicitly defined in the schema.
       Issue:DS-7267

     - Add support for multiple base DNs per resource to the SCIM Reference
       Implementation and SDK. This way a particular resource type, such as
       "User", can live under multiple base DNs.
       Issue:DS-7267

     - Add support for a new "base-id" query parameter which can be used to
       specify the SCIM resource ID of the search base entry to use.
       Issue:DS-7267

     - Add support for a new "scope" query parameter which can be used to
       specify the LDAP search scope to use when performing a search. Valid
       values are "base", "one", "sub", or "subordinate". The default is "sub".
       Issue:DS-7267

     - Add basic schema checking at the scim-ldap layer for POST, PUT, and PATCH
       operations. It currently makes sure that all required attributes are
       present and the PATCH operation will not cause schema violations.
       Issue:DS-7290

  * Resolved Issues

     - Make LDAP-to-HTTP status code mapping more consistent. Map most LDAP
       errors to HTTP status code 500 instead of 400 since it is unlikely that
       these errors are caused by the client. Issue:DS-7231

     - Fix a problem where the "Location" header did not contain the API
       version. Issue:DS-7267

     - Update the SCIM Reference Implementation and SDK to treat schema URNs and
       JSON attribute names as case-insensitive, per the SCIM specification.
       Issue:DS-7267

     - Fix a problem where the "TotalResults" counter could be incorrect when
       doing a search.
       Issue:DS-7267

     - Fix a potential NPE when searching for an entry that doesn't exist or is
       not exposed via SCIM.
       Issue:DS-7267


---------- SCIM 1.2.0 ----------

  * Release Date: October 26, 2012

  * This is an upgrade release with some significant enhancements. Users of
    previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

  * New Features

     - Add support for authentication to SCIM via OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens. This
       requires an OAuthTokenHandler extension built with the UnboundID Server
       SDK in order to decode and validate tokens. Issue:DS-6763

     - Add support for the PATCH operation in the SCIM SDK and server
       implementation. This allows for resources to be partially updated without
       having to send the entire contents of the resource across the network,
       reducing network and processing overhead. This is especially beneficial
       for resources with many attributes, such as Groups. Issue:DS-6853

     - Comply with the SCIM 1.1 schema changes: The 'phoneNumbers' attribute now
       uses the RFC3966 syntax, the group 'displayName' attribute now required,
       the group 'members' attribute is no longer required. To accommodate for
       possible differences in LDAP's phone number format, several arguments are
       added to the new TelephoneNumberTransformation so that the mapping
       behavior may be customized to fit the environment. Details about the
       arguments are in the resources.xml file. Issue:DS-6892

     - Add batch scripts so that the SCIM Reference Implementation tools can be
       run on Windows. Issue:DS-6770

  * Resolved Issues

     - Fixed a bug with the XML un-marshaller where it didn't parse
       multi-valued simple attributes correctly. Issue:DS-6892

     - Make sure that the SCIM extension behaves correctly when soft-deletes are
       enabled in the Directory Server. Issue:DS-6890

     - Enhance the SCIMException code to handle more types of errors and add a
       generic ConnectException to represent a true connection error where there
       is no response from the target server. Issue:SCIM-287


---------- SCIM 1.1.1 ----------

  * Release Date: May 9, 2012

  * This is a maintenance release that improves quality, reliability, and
    performance and adds some minimal enhancements. All users of previous
    1.x releases should upgrade to this release.

  * New Features

     - Add OAuth bearer token support to the SCIM Client SDK. Issue:SCIM-301

  * Resolved Issues

     - Fix a limitation where modifications to attributes that are mapped to a
       RDN naming attribute will result in an error instead of performing an
       additional modify DN operation to change the RDN. Issue:SCIM-308

     - Change UserResource.isActive() to return a Boolean instead of a
       primitive to allow a null return value to indicate that a value is not
       present in the resource. Issue:SCIM-300


---------- SCIM 1.1.0 ----------

  * Release Date: February 22, 2012

  * This is an upgrade release with some significant enhancements. Users of
    previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

  * New Features

     - Add support for Bulk operations as defined by the SCIM protocol.
       Issue:SCIM-31

     - Allow the SCIM resource ID to be mapped to any LDAP attribute as an
       alternative to mapping to the LDAP entry DN. The DN does not necessarily
       meet the requirements of the SCIM specification regarding resource ID
       immutability since LDAP permits entries to be renamed or moved. The
       entryUUID attribute, whose read-only value is assigned by the Directory
       Server, is a possible alternative mapping. Issue:SCIM-149

     - Update the scim-query-rate tool to use preemptive basic auth, in order to
       increase performance. Issue:SCIM-189

     - Add methods to the SCIMService class for specifying the user-agent string
       to use in the HTTP headers. Issue:SCIM-284

  * Known Issues and Workarounds

     - In connection failure scenarios, the SCIM SDK may report that HTTP
       status code 500 was received, even if no response was actually received
       from the server at all. Currently the SCIM-SDK does not have a mechanism
       to report local errors such as this. Issue:SCIM-287

  * Resolved Issues

     - Add the xmlDataFormat attribute to the ServiceProviderConfig endpoint to
       indicate that the XML data format is supported. Issue:SCIM-233

     - Update the SCIMEndpoint to catch RuntimeExceptions and wrap them with a
       SCIMException. Issue:SCIM-236

     - Fix some cases where emitted XML did not validate against the SCIM core
       XML schema, due to the incorrect sequence of elements. Also, namespace
       declarations for resource extension attributes are now omitted where they
       are not used.

     - Fix an issue where extension attributes in a JSON query response were
       being discarded during client parsing of the response. Issue:SCIM-247

     - Update the SCIM Reference Implementation to use Jetty version 8.1.0,
       which fixes several problems in the IO layer with respect to the latest
       JVMs and browsers. Issue:DS-5900

     - Fix an issue whereby a query of a user resource could result in
       unnecessary searches of the user's group memberships when the query
       requested specific attributes not including groups. Issue:SCIM-227

     - The SCIM servlet extension now checks that all LDAP attributes referenced
       in the resource definitions are defined in the server's LDAP schema.
       Issue:SCIM-262

     - Fix an issue where an error was not returned when a user without the
       unindexed-search privilege performed dynamic group lookup. Issue:SCIM-197

     - Update the SCIM extension configuration files to use a detailed format
       HTTP log publisher rather than a common format log publisher.
       Issue:SCIM-216

     - Fix an issue in which Base64-encoded binary values caused a class cast
       exception. Issue:SCIM-293
