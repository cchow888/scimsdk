---------- SCIM 1.1.0 ----------

  * Release Date: February 22, 2012

  * This is an upgrade release with some significant enhancements. Users of
    previous releases are encouraged to upgrade.

  * New Features
     
     - Add support for Bulk operations as defined by the SCIM protocol.
       Issue:SCIM-31
          
     - Allow the SCIM resource ID to be mapped to any LDAP attribute as an
       alternative to mapping to the LDAP entry DN. The DN does not necessarily
       meet the requirements of the SCIM specification regarding resource ID
       immutability since LDAP permits entries to be renamed or moved. The
       entryUUID attribute, whose read-only value is assigned by the Directory
       Server, is a possible alternative mapping. Issue:SCIM-149
       
     - Update the scim-query-rate tool to use preemptive basic auth, in order to
       increase performance. Issue:SCIM-189
       
     - Add methods to the SCIMService class for specifying the user-agent string
       to use in the HTTP headers. Issue:SCIM-284
              
  * Known Issues and Workarounds

     - In connection failure scenarios, the SCIM SDK may report that HTTP
       status code 500 was received, even if no response was actually received
       from the server at all. Currently the SCIM-SDK does not have a mechanism
       to report local errors such as this. Issue:SCIM-287

  * Resolved Issues
  
     - Add the xmlDataFormat attribute to the ServiceProviderConfig endpoint to
       indicate that the XML data format is supported. Issue:SCIM-233
  
     - Update the SCIMEndpoint to catch RuntimeExceptions and wrap them with a
       SCIMException. Issue:SCIM-236
       
     - Fix some cases where emitted XML did not validate against the SCIM core
       XML schema, due to the incorrect sequence of elements. Also, namespace
       declarations for resource extension attributes are now omitted where they
       are not used.

     - Fix an issue where extension attributes in a JSON query response were
       being discarded during client parsing of the response. Issue:SCIM-247
       
     - Update the SCIM Reference Implementation to use Jetty version 8.1.0,
       which fixes several problems in the IO layer with respect to the latest
       JVMs and browsers. Issue:DS-5900
       
     - Fix an issue whereby a query of a user resource could result in
       unnecessary searches of the user's group memberships when the query
       requested specific attributes not including groups. Issue:SCIM-227
       
     - The SCIM servlet extension now checks that all LDAP attributes referenced
       in the resource definitions are defined in the server's LDAP schema.
       Issue:SCIM-262
       
     - Fix an issue where an error was not returned when a user without the
       unindexed-search privilege performed dynamic group lookup. Issue:SCIM-197
       
     - Update the SCIM extension configuration files to use a detailed format
       HTTP log publisher rather than a common format log publisher.
       Issue:SCIM-216
       
     - Fix an issue in which Base64-encoded binary values caused a class cast
       exception. Issue:SCIM-293
