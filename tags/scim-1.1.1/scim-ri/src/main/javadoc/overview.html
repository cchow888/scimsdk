    <h2>Simple Cloud Identity Management</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://simplecloud.info" target="blank">Simple Cloud
       Identity Management (SCIM) specification</a> is designed to make managing
       user identity in cloud based applications and services easier. The
       specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas
       and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development
       and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization,
       and privacy models. It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of
       user management operations by providing a common user schema and
       extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for
       exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence, make it
       fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.

       This API contains a reference implementation (RI) of a SCIM Server, based
       on the
       <a href="http://www.unboundid.com/products/ldap-sdk/docs/in-memory-directory-server.php" target="blank">
       InMemoryDirectoryServer</a> provided by the
       <a href="http://www.unboundid.com/products/ldap-sdk/" target="blank">
       UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a>. There is also an example client included,
       which can be used to issue queries against the RI server.
